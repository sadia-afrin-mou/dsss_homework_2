    Run an interactive math quiz game where the user answers arithmetic questions.

    This function generates a series of random math problems using basic operations
    (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) and prompts the user to answer each.
    The userâ€™s answers are validated to ensure they are integers, and the score is
    updated based on correct answers.

    The game consists of a fixed number of questions. At the end, the user's score
    is displayed along with the total number of questions.

    Game Process:
        - Three questions are presented to the user.
        - For each question, two random integers and a random operation are generated.
        - The question is displayed, and the user inputs their answer.
        - The answer is validated for correct format (integer).
        - The score is incremented for each correct answer.
